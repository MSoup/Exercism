# Exercism
Exercises from exercism

These exercises will serve as a memory stamp into how far I have come. Maybe in 2021 I can look back at this and see lots of growth.

### Update 2021:

Wow, it has been a while. I can't believe I haven't stopped coding since these exercism days.  
While coding nearly everyday, it was near impossible to see improvements in my code, but now I look back and realize, *I was a baby*.  

Perhaps I'll go back to exercism soon, but with JS. Here's to a great 2021.
